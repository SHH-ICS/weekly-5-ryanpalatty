# Weekly Assignment

Starter code for weekly assignment

<b>NOTES ON PHP:</b>

<p>To test out your PHP files run the following command in the terminal:</p>

<ol><pre>php -S 0.0.0.0:8000</ol></pre>

<p>You CAN NOT save this to GitHub Pages, since it needs a server in the back end to run it you can also save it to the Class Pi Server but you will have to manually copy it there. </p>
